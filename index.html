                            Another study, funded by a Boswellia production company, found that increasing
                            the dosage of enriched Boswellia extract led to an increase in physical ability.

                            Osteoarthritis knee pain decreased after 90 days with the Boswellia product,
                            compared to a lesser dosage and placebo.

                            An older study published in the Journal of Rheumatology found that Boswellia

                            Some research suggests that Boswellia may interfere with the autoimmune process,
                            which would make it an effective therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

                        <h3>What Causes Those Stiff, Painful, and Swollen Joints?</h3>
                        <p>
                            First, arthritis is not one disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are over 100 different kinds of arthritis with various causes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rheumatoid Arthritis is caused by what is known as an Auto-immune condition
                            which means the body’s immune system is attacking the tissues of the joints.

                        <p>
                            There’s Osteoarthritis that occurs when the cartilage that cushions the bones
                            from grinding on one another starts getting destroyed…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eventually, when the cartilage in the joint completely destroys, bones begin to
                            grind on bones which causes…

                        <p>
                            There is a key inflammatory enzyme present that causes parts of the body to
                            swell and become painful.

                        <p>
                            It’s known as

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5-LO generates something called inflammatory leukotrienes…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            which cause inflammation by promoting free radical damage, calcium dislocation,
                            cell-adhesion, and migration of inflammation-producing cells to the inflamed
                            body area.

                        <p>
                            That’s why most people who tried them realized that the pain and swelling don’t

                            also known as Indian frankincense, has been used for centuries in Indian

                        <p>
                            And modern science shows that Boswellia works by increasing blood flow to the
                            joints, and by inhibiting the body’s production of inflammatory chemicals called

                            That way 5-LO is placed under check and new cartilages are grown to support

                            A clinical trial conducted by Raychaudhuri and co-workers in India has shown
                            that the extract of the plant, Boswellia serrata, can reduce pain and
                            considerably improve knee-joint functions, in some cases providing relief even
                            within a few days.

                            A 2010 clinical trial found that a Terathydrocurcumin supplement provided

                                    several trado-medical options (local methods) and orthodox ones.

                        <p>
                            We often advise that people take the three months' pack for three reasons…</p>

                        <p>
                            <b>First,
                            </b>
                            it's getting harder to bring in Boscure and Boniac from India where they are
                            manufactured due to COVID reasons…
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We can't assure you that you'll still be able to get another pack the next time
                            you try to order. People are taking up the 3 months' plan pretty fast.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Secondly
                            </b>, the 3-month pack comes with a bonus not available on the other plans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because of how much we're able to save on shipping 3 months pack together…
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We decided to pass on the relief to you by adding another product we once sold
                            for N20,500.
                        </p>

                            it's more economical (a huge saving of about N60,000).
